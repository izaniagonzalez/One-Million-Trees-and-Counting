      <h1>One Million Trees is not enough for New York City</h1>
      <h4>By Izania Gonzalez</h4>
      <article>
        <p>It's no secret that trees are essential to keeping air clean, filtering out carbon dioxide, and producing oxygen for us to breathe, which is why New York City's tree population means so much. The city's population continues to grow but with a current number of 8.4 million that's a lot of air to keep clean for a lot of people. In a project funded by the New York City Parks and Recreation Department one million trees were planted over nearly 13 years.</p>
        <p>In a 2011 study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it was found that 1,500-2,000 deaths and 4,500-5,200 asthma related emergency department vists annually are related to exposures to fine particles of pollution, known as PM2.5. Pollution comes in as the most significant environmental health problem, causing roughly 6% of deaths annually in the city. Planting more trees is one of many ways to assist in air filter </p>
        <p>A 1995 tree count shows the number of trees in each neighborhood. </p>

</script>
        <p>Compared to data collected in 2015 the tree count has jumped significantly. The overall average of trees for the city increased by 1,886. It hardly looks like much on the map but the numbers speak for themselves. The most significant change can be seen in the Bronx neighborhood of Hunts Point. 20 years saw 3,234 trees planted in the neighborhood in an attempt to help air pollution. </p>

</script>
        <p>While a million trees is an ambitious undertaking that succeeded, it is not enough trees to counteract the pollution of the city. According to the <a href="https://nyc-ghg-inventory.cusp.nyu.edu/">Inventory of NYC's Greenhouse Gas Emission</a> in 2019 the emissions for the whole city were calculated at 55 million metric tons. One tree on average can filter 1 ton of carbon dioxide in 40 years. Even with over a million trees in the city we are emitting greenhouse gases far faster than they could ever be filtered.</p>
